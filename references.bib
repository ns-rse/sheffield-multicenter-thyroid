	abstract = {{The R package mice imputes incomplete multivariate data by chained equations. The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range of models under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.}}

In this paper, we introduce a new coefficient also based on the Kendall-$\tau$ distance, the Concordance coefficient, and a test to measure whether different samples come from the same distribution. This work also presents a new R package, ConcordanceTest, with the implementation of the proposed coefficient. We illustrate the use of the Concordance coefficient to measure the ordinal association between quantity and quality measures when two or more samples are considered. In this sense, the Concordance coefficient can be seen as a generalization of the Kendall rank correlation coefficient and an alternative to the non-parametric mean rank-based methods for comparing two or more samples. A comparison of the proposed Concordance coefficient and the classical Kruskal-Wallis statistic is presented through a comparison of the exact distributions of both statistics.}}

	abstract = {{Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.}}

	abstract = {{Stepwise regression is a popular data-mining tool that uses statistical significance to select the explanatory variables to be used in a multiple-regression model. A fundamental problem with stepwise regression is that some real explanatory variables that have causal effects on the dependent variable may happen to not be statistically significant, while nuisance variables may be coincidentally significant. As a result, the model may fit the data well in-sample, but do poorly out-of-sample. Many Big-Data researchers believe that, the larger the number of possible explanatory variables, the more useful is stepwise regression for selecting explanatory variables. The reality is that stepwise regression is less effective the larger the number of potential explanatory variables. Stepwise regression does not solve the Big-Data problem of too many explanatory variables. Big Data exacerbates the failings of stepwise regression.}}

@article{steyerberg2001,
    abstract = {Clinical decision making often requires estimates of the likelihood of a dichotomous outcome in individual patients. When empirical data are available, these estimates may well be obtained from a logistic regression model. Several strategies may be followed in the development of such a model. In this study, the authors compare alternative strategies in 23 small subsamples from a large data set of patients with an acute myocardial infarction, where they developed predictive models for 30-day mortality. Evaluations were performed in an independent part of the data set. Specifically, the authors studied the effect of coding of covariables and stepwise selection on discriminative ability of the resulting model, and the effect of statistical  ” shrinkage” techniques on calibration. As expected, dichotomization of continuous covariables implied a loss of information. Remarkably, stepwise selection resulted in less discriminating models compared to full models including all available covariables, even when more than half of these were randomly associated with the outcome. Using qualitative information on the sign of the effect of predictors slightly improved the predictive ability. Calibration improved when shrinkage was applied on the standard maximum likelihood estimates of the regression coefficients. In conclusion, a sensible strategy in small data sets is to apply shrinkage methods in full models that include well-coded predictors that are selected based on external information.},

    abstract = {Stepwise methods are frequently employed in educational and psychological research, both to select useful subsets of variables and to evaluate the order of importance of variables. Three problems with stepwise applications are explored in some detail. First, computer packages use incorrect degrees of freedom in their stepwise computations, resulting in artifactually greater likelihood of obtaining spurious statistical significance. Second, stepwise methods do not correctly identify the best variable set of a given size, as illustrated by a concrete heuristic example. Third, stepwise methods tend to capitalize on sampling error and thus tend to yield results that are not replicable.},

Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p{$\gg$}n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.}}

In addition, a limited set of additional mutations in key genes drive tumour progression towards more aggressive and less differentiated disease. Unprecedented insights into thyroid tumour biology have come from the breadth of thyroid tumour sequencing data from patients and the wide range of mutation-specific mechanisms identified in experimental models, in combination with the genomic simplicity of thyroid cancers. This knowledge is gradually being translated into refined strategies to stratify, manage and treat patients with thyroid cancer. This Review summarizes the biological underpinnings of the genetic alterations involved in thyroid cancer initiation and progression. We also provide a rationale for and discuss specific examples of how to implement genomic information to inform both recommended and investigational approaches to improve thyroid cancer prognosis, redifferentiation strategies and targeted therapies.}}
