## I'm new to using purrr but from what I can work out/understand so far and the way we want to use it we start with a
## dataset that is piped into purrr::map() the first thing we do is then define how we will refer to this dataset using
## the notation `\(<some_name>)` we then provide a function we wish to apply to each split of the data and use
## `<some_name>` as an argument to that function.

## Use an imputed data set (cart) and purrr::map() to apply the split to each imputed dataset. We first remove the
## "Original" that is included in the data and the .id variable
## purrr_split is a list of data frames.
cart_imputed <- mice_cart$imputed |>
    dplyr::filter(.imp != "Original") |>
    dplyr::mutate(.imp = droplevels(.imp)) |>
    dplyr::select(-.id)
purrr_split <- cart_imputed |>
    split(cart_imputed$.imp) |>
    purrr::map(\(df) rsample::initial_split(df, prop = 0.75))

## This does the same but includes "Original", which we know won't work well due to missing data.
## purrr_split <- mice_cart$imputed |>
##     split(mice_cart$imputed$.imp) |>
##     purrr::map(\(df) rsample::initial_split(df, prop = 0.75))

## Then derive a training and test dataset for each imputed dataset.
## purrr_train and purrr_test are again lists of data frames.
purrr_train <- purrr_split |>
    purrr::map(\(split) rsample::training(split))
purrr_test <- purrr_split |>
    purrr::map(\(split) rsample::test(split))

## !!!!!!INFO!!!!!!
##
## You can look at purrr_thyroid_recipe_imputed and see it is a list of two identical recipes (just enter
## 'purrr_thyroid_recipe_imputed' without quotes at the R console and hit Return)
